2. subscribe a stock price tracing and when the daily stock price is lower than what you expected(as you input), the mail robot will automatically send you an email to remind you of the stock price around 6 pm.

Just click the link ![http://mailer.crazygriferman.com/](http://mailer.crazygriferman.com/) and try it!
